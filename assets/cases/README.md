# Case Study Media Organization

To feed the "Design Power" engine and the Draggable Hero, organize your project files into the following directories in the GitHub repository:

## Folders
- `./assets/cases/unmplynmt/`
- `./assets/cases/just-boxes/`
- `./assets/cases/surfboard-v001/`
- `./assets/cases/the-cartridges/`
- `./assets/cases/jonheys-dumpling-house/`
- `./assets/cases/franca-austral/`
- `./assets/cases/traveller-entrepreneur/`

## Recommended File Naming
- `hero.jpg` (Primary feature image)
- `detail-1.jpg`, `detail-2.jpg`, etc. (Rich media for Draggable Hero)
- `process-1.jpg`, `process-2.jpg` (Strategy & Gap section images)

*Note: Use .jpg, .png, or .webp. Ensure filenames match exactly what is defined in `constants.ts`.*
